You are given an integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and array A[1 … n] that contains non-negative integers not bigger than 109.

Find the biggest non-ascending subsequence in A.

In the first line, output its length k, in the second on — its indexes  (thus, A[i1] ≥ A[i2] ≥ … ≥ A[in].

If there are several matching subsequences, output any of them.
